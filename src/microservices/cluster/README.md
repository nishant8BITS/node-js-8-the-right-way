# ZMQ and higher-level messaging patterns.


Our master Node.js process will create ROUTER and DEALER sockets and
spin up the workers. Each worker will create a REP socket that connects back
to the DEALER.
The following figure illustrates how all these pieces fit together.
The rectangles represent Node.js processes. The ovals are the resources
bound by Ã˜MQ sockets, and the arrows show which sockets connect to which
endpoin
